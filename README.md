# Real-time Camera Pinch Draw App

## Overview

The Real-time Camera Pinch Draw App is a browser-based tool that lets you draw directly on a live camera feed using only your hand gestures. It uses your device’s camera and real-time hand tracking to detect when you pinch your thumb and index finger together — starting a brush stroke. Opening your hand stops drawing. The camera feed is mirrored like a selfie for a natural, intuitive experience.

## Features

* **Real-time Hand Tracking:** Displays a mirrored skeleton overlay of your hand.
* **Pinch-to-Draw Gesture:** Pinching starts drawing, opening stops.
* **Customizable Controls:** Change brush color, brush size, pinch sensitivity, and pointer smoothing.
* **Precise Brush Offset:** Brush tip aligns more naturally with your fingertip.
* **Selfie Mirroring:** Feels intuitive when viewing your movements.

## How to Use

1. Open the app in a supported browser.
2. Click **Start Camera** and allow camera access when prompted.
3. Keep your hand visible to the camera.
4. Pinch thumb and index finger to draw.
5. Adjust brush and sensitivity in the controls.
6. Open your hand to stop drawing.
